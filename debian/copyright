      this program.
   2. You are free to modify this program for your own use,
      including commercial use, subject to the publication
      restrictions in item 3.
   3. You are free to publish results obtained from running this
      program, or from works that you derive from this program,
      with the following limitations:
      3a. In order to be referred to as "STREAM benchmark results",
          published results must be in conformance to the STREAM
          Run Rules, (briefly reviewed below) published at
          http://www.cs.virginia.edu/stream/ref.html
          and incorporated herein by reference.
          As the copyright holder, John McCalpin retains the
          right to determine conformity with the Run Rules.
      3b. Results based on modified source code or on runs not in
          accordance with the STREAM Run Rules must be clearly
          labelled whenever they are published.  Examples of
          proper labelling include:
          "tuned STREAM benchmark results"
          "based on a variant of the STREAM benchmark code"
          Other comparable, clear and reasonable labelling is
          acceptable.
      3c. Submission of results to the STREAM benchmark web site
          is encouraged, but not required.
   4. Use of this program or creation of derived works based on this
      program constitutes acceptance of these licensing restrictions.
   5. Absolutely no warranty is expressed or implied.
