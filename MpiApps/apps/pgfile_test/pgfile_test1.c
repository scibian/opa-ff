/*
 * The purpose of these programs (pgfile_test1 and pgfile_test2)
 * is to demonstrate how to use the pgfile capability in mpirun_rsh.
 *
 * pgfile_test1 should be the first program in the pgfile. It accepts
 * numeric arguments from the pgfile and passes them to the next program in
 * the pgfile, which should be pgfile_test2.
 *
 * pgfile_test2 accepts a message containing a set of numbers from the previous
 * program in the pgfile, adds them to its own arguments and passes the
 * result to the following program. The last instance then passes its result
 * back to pgfile_test1, which prints the final result.
