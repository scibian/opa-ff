This program is meant to aid in developing and debugging the shared memory
interface between the QLogic Distributed SA (Discovery) and the opasadb user
library. It has 3 modes.

In server mode, the tool exercises the creation portion of the interface,
by reading a formatted table of fabric information (see buildtable.pl) and
creating a set of tables to match. If the number of passes is greater than
1, server mode will do this repeatedly, with a one second delay between
passes, to simulate a changing fabric.

In dump mode, the tool reads the current shared memory interface and dumps the 
contents to the specified file. Note that the resulting file could be huge if
the hash tables are "full sized". (See HASH_TABLE_SIZE in opasadb_path_private.h)

In client mode, the tool reads the same formatted file the server mode does,
but then randomly picks records from the file and queries for them. It will
return an error if the record that was returned does not match the record
loaded from the file.
