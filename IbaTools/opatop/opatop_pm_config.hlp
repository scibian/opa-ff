HELP: PM CONFIG SCREEN
The PM Configuration screen displays information as provided by the PM.
The Sweep Interval parameter is separate from the opatop interval.
Normally the opatop interval should be set to a value >= Sweep Interval.
PM image configuration information (total images, freeze images, freeze
lease time), category thresholds and weights, PM memory footprint, and PM MAD
retry/timeout information is shown.  The PM Config screen has no
screen-specific input commands.
