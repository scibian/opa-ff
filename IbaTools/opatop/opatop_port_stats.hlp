HELP: PORT STATS SCREEN
The Port Statistics screen displays a port's performance counters.
Performance counters are grouped according to the category to which they
belong.  A trailing asterisk ('*') on the counter name indicates the counter
will be tabulated against the neighbor ports category statistics.

The Port Statistics screen is split over two pages, which can be accessed by
scrolling forward or backward to access more port statistics. When the Port
Stats screen is entered from the Group Focus or VF Focus screen, port neighbor
and link information is available.  When the Port Stats screen is entered from
the Group Config or VF Config screen, this information is not available.  The
second line of the Port Stats screen displays the group name, and LID and port
number of the port, as well as link rate and MTU (if available).  The third line
of the screen displays the NodeDesc and node GUID of the port.  The fourth line
of the screen displays the NodeDesc, LID and port number of the neighbor port
(if available). These four lines repeat on both pages of the Port Statistics
screen.

The remaining lines on the pages are used to display the groups of error
counters. The last category, SmaCongestion, shows counters gathered using VF
Port Counters query (if available). The Port Stats screen accepts the following
input commands.

  V: Switch to VF port statistics for the port in the selected VF (if available)
  N: Switch between statistics for port and port's neighbor (if available)
  S: Scroll forward (s*) or backward (S*) through counter pages
